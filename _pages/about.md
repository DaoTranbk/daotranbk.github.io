# Biography
Hi there, welcome to my personal page! 

I am currently an AI Researcher at [FPT Software AI Center](https://www.fpt-aicenter.com/), Vietnam (previously AI Research Resident under the supervision of Dr. Hoang Thanh Tung). I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science under the supervision of [Prof. Huynh Thi Thanh Binh](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/binhht/) at the [School of Information and Communication Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/en/) (SOICT), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) (HUST), Vietnam. 

My research interests lie in the intersection of optimization, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I am interested in the topics of natural language processing, operations research, graph neural networks, reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation. Currently, I am focusing on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and their applications in optimization problems.
